# Dataset
The materials used in this study are obtained from the Satellite Oceano-graphic Data (AVISO+) product(https://data.aviso.altimetry.fr/aviso-gateway/data/META3.1exp_DT/), which cover the years from 1993 to 2020 and include amplitude, radius, speed-average, latitude, longitude, and time data. However, the size of the pre-processed data is too large so that we could notupload the data. Therefore, please download the data for yourself.
